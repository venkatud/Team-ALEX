# Unified Threat Monitoring System

This project integrates multiple threat monitoring systems into a single Python-based tool. It covers physical, network, quantum, and machine learning-based anomaly detection, utilizing advanced quantum and classical computing techniques.

## Features

- **Physical Threat Monitoring**: Detects environmental anomalies such as extreme temperature, excessive vibration, and unauthorized access.
- **Network Threat Monitoring**: Monitors network traffic and detects suspicious IP activities.
- **Quantum Threat Simulation**: Simulates quantum computation errors using IBM Quantum services and noise models.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual data points using machine learning with Isolation Forests.

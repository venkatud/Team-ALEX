# Security Tool with Quantum Anomaly Detection

This project is a multi-functional security tool designed to perform various cybersecurity tasks, such as monitoring for ransomware, detecting DoS attacks, scanning files for malware, and implementing quantum-based anomaly detection.

## Features
- **URL Analysis**: Detects potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in URLs.
- **File Integrity Checking**: Calculates and verifies file hashes to monitor for unauthorized changes.
- **Ransomware Detection**: Monitors a directory for suspicious file modifications.
- **DoS Detection**: Analyzes network traffic to identify potential denial-of-service attacks.
- **Quantum Anomaly Detection**: Uses quantum principles to detect anomalies in data points.

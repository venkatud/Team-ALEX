Quantum computers



## Requirements

The system uses several Python libraries for quantum computing, network sniffing, threading, and machine learning.

### Key Libraries
- `qiskit` (Quantum computation and simulation)
- `qiskit-ibm-provider` (Access IBM Quantum backends)
- `qiskit-aer` (Simulate quantum devices)
- `scapy` (Network sniffing)
- `sklearn` (Machine learning)
- `numpy` (Numerical calculations)

See the `requirements.txt` file for the full list of dependencies.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/unified-threat-monitoring.git
   cd unified-threat-monitoring
Create a virtual environment (recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your IBM Quantum account:

Sign up or log in at IBM Quantum.
Obtain your API token and save it securely.
Replace the placeholder token in the script with your token.
Usage
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python unified_threat_monitoring.py
The tool will start four monitoring threads:

Physical threat monitoring.
Network traffic monitoring.
Quantum error simulation.
Machine learning anomaly detection.
Alerts and anomalies will be logged to the console.

Notes
The script uses Scapy for network sniffing. It may require root or administrator privileges to run.
Ensure you have access to an IBM Quantum account to use quantum computing features.

## Requirements
The project is built with Python and uses libraries for quantum computation, file monitoring, and network sniffing.

### Key Libraries
- `qiskit` (Quantum computation)
- `numpy` (Numerical calculations)
- `watchdog` (File monitoring)
- `scapy` (Network sniffing)
  
For a full list of dependencies, see the `requirements.txt`.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/security-tool.git
   cd security-tool
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure you have the necessary quantum backend installed for qiskit:

bash
Copy code
pip install qiskit-aer
Set up the monitored directory:

bash
Copy code
mkdir monitored_files
Usage
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python security_tool.py
Select an option from the menu:

Analyze URL
Scan File for Malware
Check SQL Injection
Detect Web Attacks
Monitor Directory for Ransomware
Monitor Network Traffic for DoS
Follow the prompts for each option.
